🧰 Project Title:

IP and Network Info Tool

Meaning / Description:

The IP and Network Info Tool is a simple Unix-based shell script that displays important information about the system’s network configuration.

It helps the user to view the system’s IP address, list all available network interfaces, and count the number of active network connections currently open on the system.

Main Features:

Display System IP Address

Shows the local IP (like 192.168.1.5) assigned to your system.

Display Network Interfaces

Lists all active interfaces (like eth0, wlan0, lo).

Display Active Connections

Counts and shows the number of currently active network connections.
🧩 Objectives:

To display the system’s IP address.

To list the active network interface(s).

To show the number of active connections.

To practice using Unix networking commands and scripting.

To create a user-friendly tool for basic network information.

🧠 Concepts Used:
Shell scripting (variables, commands, output formatting)

Unix networking utilities (ip, hostname, ss)

Command substitution ($(...))

Piping and filtering (|, grep, awk)

📚 Applications:

System administrators can quickly check network info.

Useful for troubleshooting or network diagnostics.

Can be extended to monitor connection logs or detect IP changes.

Educational tool for understanding basic Unix networking commands.

✅ Conclusion:

The IP and Network Info Tool successfully displays the system’s network information — including IP address, active interface, and active connections — in a clear and organized format.
This project demonstrates the power and simplicity of Unix shell scripting in automating system tasks and extracting useful information from the operating system.
