🧠 Project Title:

IP and Networking Tools in Unix

🎯 Objective:

To create a Unix-based command-line tool that gathers and displays network-related information such as:

System IP address

Active network interfaces

Active network connections

Hostname and DNS info

Ping/Connectivity test

This project helps users understand how Unix handles networking through system calls and shell commands.

⚙️ Tools & Technologies Used:

Unix/Linux shell scripting (bash)

Commands: ifconfig, ip, netstat, ping, hostname, nslookup

Optional: awk, grep, sed for parsing output

🏗️ Project Description:

The IP and Networking Tools project is a Unix shell script that collects and displays various details about the system’s network configuration and connections.
It’s similar to a lightweight diagnostic tool (like a mini version of ifconfig or ip addr show).

🧩 Features:

Display System Hostname

Show IP Address(es)

List Active Network Interfaces

Count Active Connections

Ping Test for Connectivity

Display DNS Information 

🌟 Features:

✅ Menu-driven interface
✅ Shows hostname and IP address
✅ Lists interfaces and connections
✅ Includes ping and DNS tools
✅ Works on any Unix/Linux system
